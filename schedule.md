This course runs from September 22nd to December 12th, 2014.

### Weekly Schedule

__Monday - Thursday__

9am - 12pm will be lecture time. We will have a break halfway through.

1pm - 5pm will be lab time.

__Friday__

9am - 5pm will be lab time.

### Instructor & T.A. Availability

During lab time either your instructor or a T.A. will be available to assist you with any problems you run into. Keep in mind that often the best way to learn is to work through the situation by yourself, but we will be available to assist.

From time to time your instructor and/or T.A will have a meeting and will be unavailable. If this is the case, we will try to let you know ahead of time.

There is also a chance we will be available via HipChat or [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/) in the evenings or weekends. If we are and can help we will do so, but don't plan on this. Make sure to ask any questions you have before you leave for the day.
